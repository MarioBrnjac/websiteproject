		<p id="slayerdescription">The demons first gave him the appellation "Doom Slayer" and also refer to him as the Unchained Predator, the Beast, and the Hellwalker. The UAC refers to the him as DOOM Marine, or The Slayer. The UAC’s most remarkable discovery was in Hell’s Kadingir Sanctum. Surrounded by nearly impassable terrain, the team discovered a sealed tomb – its entrance and walls covered in protective runes and imprisonment incantations. The tomb revealed many artifacts, including the Praetor suit. Most notable, however, was an enormous sarcophagus bound to the center bedrock of the tomb with thick iron bands – seemingly anchored to prevent anything from getting in or out. It was believed this sarcophagus must hold a rare or powerful demon, but when later opened, it revealed the body of a man. Unrelenting; unforgiving; driven by a rage that cannot be contained. The Doom Slayer has been to Hell and brought it to its knees. He has no records, and he seems to vanish as quickly as he appears. The few witness accounts available detail a ruthless killer. The Doom Slayer is Hells main enemy and he has only one objective. To rip and tear until it is done.</p>
