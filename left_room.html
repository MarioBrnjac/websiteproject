		<h3 id="demontitle">Super Shotgun</h3>

		<p id="enemydescription">The Super Shotgun deals heaps of damage up close, gibbing those weak fodder demons in one hit. Its wide spread brings down multiple fodder demons with a single shot. Its massive stopping power can cause most heavy demons to stumble. The gun retains its usefulness at medium ranges. This makes it a useful weapon for clearing out groups of fodder demons, or taking down particularly tanky heavy demons.</p>

		<h3 id="demontitle">The Crucible</h3>

		<p id="enemydescription">The Crucible is the personal weapon of the Doom Slayer himself, having been wielded during his time as a Night Sentinel. He lost the weapon after using it to slay a Titan on Taras Nabad, which marked the start of his legend among the Sentinels. </p>

		<h3 id="demontitle">The Doomblade</h3>

		<p id="enemydescription">A modification to the Praetor suit, the arm-mounted Doomblade is designed to increase the Slayer's short-range striking power. Strong enough to sever demonic flesh and bone, the blade's serrated edge allows the Slayer to break through enemy defenses and attack where conventional weaponry is ineffective.</p>

		<h3 id="demontitle">Heavy Cannon</h3>

		<p id="enemydescription">A common complaint among users of this punch-packing conventional weapon is the weight, as most of the components are forged in Tungstronium, a proprietary alloy developed to withstand enormous stresses imparted by the optional exploding dart ammunition. However, the additional weight makes the Heavy Cannon an ideal sniper rifle, as swaying and tremors are mitigated by the massive bulk. Trigger management is of the highest priority when using this weapon, as self-inflicted gunshot wounds are common thanks to its no-pull reflex trigger system.</p>

		<h3 id="demontitle">Plasma Rifle</h3>

		<p id="enemydescription">Designed by the UAC's military-tech division, the Plasma Rifle is the standard in energy-based weaponry. Firing a superheated plasma in rapid-short burst intervals, the Plasma Rifle is capable of overloading energy-based shielding and liquefying enemy combatants.</p>

		<p id="enemydescription">The BFG 9000 is a weapon in Doom. It is a massively powerful plasma energy weapon which utilizes ionized Argent Energy. The BFG 9000 fires a green burst of plasma, damaging enemies near the projectile during flight and vaporising targets upon impact, as well as causing significant splash damage to enemies standing in the vicinity of the projectile's explosion.</p>
