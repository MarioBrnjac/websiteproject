		<h3 id="demontitle">Unwilling</h3>

		<p id="enemydescription">The Unwilling are fully transformed Possessed that have been transported to Hell to serve as shrine worshippers, slave labor for higher level demons, or cannon fodder for battle within hell.</p>

		<h3 id="demontitle">Zombie</h3>

		<p id="enemydescription">Possessed by the influence of Hell, once human underlings that follow in Hell's ranks are those that have been corrupted and deceived by its power, forsaking their own humanity. Those who have fully succumbed to Hell's will cannot be saved, becoming mindless, grotesque contortions of their former selves.</p>

		<h3 id="demontitle">Imp</h3>

		<p id="enemydescription">Scavengers of the underworld, Imps are among the most common of beasts found on the scorched surface of the Hellscape. Lesser demons of Hell, the Imp possesses limited intelligence, driven only by a hunter's impulse to seek out prey - a task for which the Imp is naturally suited due to its innate capacity for violence. As a result of these attributes, the Imp makes for an ideal footsoldier and is oft deployed in the warring legions of Hell, easily manipulated and controlled by commanding highborne demons at the behest of the sovereign chapters. It is common for the Imp to appear at the frontline of an offensive attack, an expendable resource unleashed in great numbers to overcome and break through the enemy front.</p>

		<p id="enemydescription">Once frontline infantry fighting to protect Earth from the demon invasion, the Hell Soldiers have been claimed by darkness, turning them against their fellow soldiers in the midst of battle.</p>

	<div id="hellknightdescborder">

		<h3 id="demontitle">Hell Knight</h3>

		<p id="enemydescription">The Hell Knight, warrior beast among demons, has earned its place over the millennia in service of the eternal Archdemons. As imposed by the sovereign houses, Hell Knights have long served as barbaric enforcers of the Netherworld, impelling lesser demons by way of brutality. Rare among demon-kind for its innate regard from primal orders of hierarchy, the Hell Knight exhibits adherence to the prevailing rule of its demonlord masters. Requiring little compulsion on behalf of its highborne masters, Hell Knights readily serve the Elder Hell-gods for the extent of their lifespans, reaping great satisfaction in the way of war and desecration.</p>

	<div id="mancubusdescborder">

		<h3 id="demontitle">Mancubus</h3>

		<p id="enemydescription">The Mancubus, hulking behemoth of the demon world, bears notable differences from those of its kind first encountered by the UAC expedition team on Mars. Unlike its brethren which wore a naturally occurring armored carapace, this variation shows clear signs of pre-existing man-made modifications. Armor-plating augmentation to its exterior and a sophisticated arm-mounted weapon system indicate a clear intent to upgrade and weaponize the fighting capacity of the Mancubus, whose heavy stature and resilience make it a formidable threat in battle.</p>

	<div id="cacodemondescborder">

		<h3 id="demontitle">Cacodemon</h3>

		<p id="enemydescription">Hunters of the Sloughlands, the Cacodemon lurks the bottomless and murky depths of Hell in search of easy prey. An aimless wanderer, the Cacodemon is mostly devoid of cognitive ability, sensory awareness, and otherwise commonly occurring impulses. Driven only by a singular desire to feed, the Cacodemon is likely to appear wherever there is flesh to be consumed, bringing with it an insatiable propensity for hunger. It is said that the Cacodemon bears some resemblance to the cycloptic titans of ancient Hell lore, leading Sentinel scholars to believe that the forgotten titans may yet live on in some disembodied form.</p>

		</div>

	<div id="hellbarondemondescborder">

		<h3 id="demontitle">Baron of Hell</h3>

		<p id="enemydescription">The Fireborne Barons have evolved from the descendant clan of the Baron hell breed, and are indigenous to the caustic, scorched hellscapes bordering the Burning Abyss. A landscape of cragged spires forged from unbreakable Blackstone, tempered by the crashing waves of the magmatic tide, these sulfuric planes of Hell have long served as banishing grounds - a place of the exodus to which the damned are sentenced as their final destination. The Fireborne Barons have evolved in this environment, sustaining themselves on the remnants of the damned, growing obsidian carapaces and in time becoming infused with the very incendiary matter of Hell itself.</p>
